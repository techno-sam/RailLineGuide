The trackage was built that day. On the 19th, interlocking was completed.

These platforms sit alongside opposing sidings of the [[Personhood Western Bypass]] whose tracks bisect the village.  The second pair of platforms is located below ground in the Panda Reserve Tunnel which is part of the [[Personhood City Tunnel]] line of the [[Personhood Metrorail]] system.\n\nAlso located within the station on the lower level is the Bamboo Bay Cafe, an ATM and the ticket office.\n\n== History ==\nTrain service first began at the station on the 8th day of June, 2020 when the {{S16a}} was rerouted to loop around the bay instead of terminating at [[Deep Valley Mountain Station]], the {{S16b}} was initiated to loop in the opposite direction within the village and the {{S17}} was initiated to serve Deep Valley Mountain instead of {{S16a}}.

The {{S16a}} became the {{S16}} on 06 October 2020.\n\nThe station underwent a couple of changes after its initial construction before it opened six months later.  Originally, the station only had the two above ground platforms.  The {{S16a}} passed diagonally under the new station in the Panda Reserve Tunnel on its way to and from the nearby [[Panda Reserve Station]] to which there was a short walkway tunnel connecting the two stations.

[[E1]] trains pass underneath on the [[Spawn 21-Anju Crossing Line]] without stopping and [[S12]] trains wait for a clear signal through to Spawn Main before departing in order to give priority to the express trains.\n\nThe station's construction is built out of stone bricks, stone blocks, and coal stone bricks. It is roofed with jungle wood and has windows of ordinary glass. It has a series of arches above the passenger platforms. The station sits in the shadow of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] making it somewhat dark.\n\n== History ==\nA station appears at this location on the first map render, 2017-08-24, so it existed very early in the server's history. The station originally had no roof and the tunnel to [[Lesnoi]] seems to have only just begun at the time of that first map render. The roof was added between 2017-11-26/2017-12-14, by which time the railway had already reached just past Ehlodex to {{Station|Lusin Street}}.\n\nThe station was bypassed with the [[Spawn 21-Anju Crossing Line]] around 2020-01-23, built by {{Player|orwell}}, moving E1 trains underground. Shortly afterwards, {{Player|Blockhead}} noticed too many E1 trains stopping for S12 trains on the short stretch of track to the junction with the [[Spawn-Origin Mainline]], so a LuaATC command was introduced so that S12 trains will check if they can get a clear route through to Spawn Main before departing. That LuaATC may have been responsible for a memory leak, similar to how [[South Forest Subway]]'s LuaATC was suspected before the moved to Minetest 5; in any case a minetest update resolved the memory leak.\n\nProper signage (station name, destination/directions, S-Bahn signs) were added 2020-12-05 when making this wiki page.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nCoL_PlatformW_ViewN.png|An S12 trains waits before departing south for Spawn Main.\nCoL_EntranceEast_ViewWest.png|The east entrance, on Sakharov Street.\nCoL_ViewSouth_S12SignalPrio.png|An S12 train waiting for a clear route to Spawn Main before heading south, giving priority to E1 trains.\nCoL_EntranceSW.png|The southwest entrance.\nCoL-Bld_Corridor.png|The intersection of the corridor of Community of Laza with that of BlackDog Subway Station.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:S12]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Spawn]]",

It has platforms of plain stone with dirt and stone brick platform edges. It has minimal lighting with torches and mese lamps. There is a jungle wood pedestrian overpass as well as good signage and two subway maps. \n\n== History ==\nThe station was opened in June 2017 with the rest of Line 6 and Line 7. At that time, the section from Darwin Road to [[University Subway Station|University]] was shared between Lines 6 and 7.\n\nIn December 2017, when Line 7 was broken off Line 2, the tracks joined one station further north at [[Half-Mile Island Subway Station|Half-Mile Island]] instead. As a result, there was no longer direct service between [[Museum Subway Station|Museum]] and this station. A shuttle train was added that operated between Darwin Road and Museum, with an intermediate unnamed stop. It operated over the old Line 7 tracks. The shuttle platform is still acessible at the station behind the eastern platform and the shuttle train sits there, unoperational.\n\nIt is thought that Line 7 was split off some time in 2018 or possibly 2019, though evidence is scarce. Now only Line 6 trains operate at this station, but the remnants of the sharing can still be seen. In particular, one can see the northbound platform has two signals, one for Line 6 trains to go north to Half-Mile Island and one for Line 7 trains to go east to Museum. Diverging Line 7 trains used to depart through the track that is now the shuttle train platform, and converging Line 7 trains used to arrive from the track on the other side of the station, which passes under the railway bridge just north of the station. Apart from converging to the tracks of this station, the track on the west side of the station also diverges and heads west towards [[Mountain South Station]], though it is not known to have ever been used.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nDarwinRdStn_ViewNE.png|View northeast from the west platform, with a train headed south.\nDarwinRdStn_ShuttlePlatformSign.png|Looking north from the east platform.

The name is a reference to Three Mile Island, the site of a famous partial nuclear meltdown in Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nThe station's construction is basic and somewhat cramped. It has platforms of jungle wood with sandstone platform edges (probably an indication of the age of the station, since only stone brick and sandstone are available in the basic advtrains platforms) along with the western wall of stone tiles with obsidian glass.\n\nOn the south side of the station, is the section of the [[Spawn-Shanielle Park]] mainline, between [[Spawn Main Station]] and [[Mountain South Station]]. It has a level crossing with Darwin Road (a major generated path).\n\n== History ==\nThe station was opened in June 2017 with the rest of the line 6. Line 6 was a ring line at that time. There was also a proposal to name the station Scottish Powerplant after {{Player|ScottishLion83}}, the owner of the power plant, but the name Half-Mile Island was final.\n\nAt the station's opening, it was only served by Line 6 trains. However the section between Darwin Road and Archangel was shared between Lines 6 and 7. The result was a complicated signalling arrangement which can still be seen today, with multiple colour light signals present at Perelman Street, Half-Mile Island and Darwin Road to deal with the complexity of multiple-line operation as well as converging and diverging routes (See [[Spawn Subway Line 6]] for further information). The shared section was retired some time between January and July 2018 and now the tracks are completely separate; however the signals remain and can still be seen.\n\nLine 6 was completely interlocked in August 2019, including this station. The Line 7 track pair remains on LuaATC.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nHalfMileStation-ViewSW.png|Looking southwest across the platforms, with trains on line 6 and 7 both heading south.\nHalfMileIsland-DarwinRoad-Mainline.png|The [[Spawn-Shanielle Park]] mainline tracks at their level crossing with Darwin Road and an [[E1]] train passing west.

A large obsidian glass ceiling reveals much of the subway beneath and provides excellent natural light. Lighting is also provided by both torches and on the lower level by glow glass. Colour coding for each line is given in wool on each platform and on the excellent signage, and fences protect travellers from falling down stairs.\n\nThe platforms are built as a cross-platform interchange: to switch between lines you only need to walk across the platform.\n\nJust north of the station is the Spawn town hall, and on the southwest out the front of Hotel Shanielle is a music player for Ode to Joy.\n\n== Cross-platform interchange operation ==\nA cross-platform interchange system that easily lets passengers transfer lines is in use at this station. Ordinarily Line 3 is below Line 4 in depth, but at this station Line 3 trains rise one way to the upper level and the Line 4 trains descend one way to the lower level, then return to their ordinary depth after the station. You can  see this in action through the viewports at the west and east ends of the station.\n\n[[File:Hotel Shanielle Viewport.png|thumb|The subway tracks visible at the west end of the station behind obsidian glass. A Line 4 train is re-joining the line after climbing back up from the lower platform; it will go to {{U4W}}. The track going downwards is for Line 3 trains towards {{U3S}} to go back down lower where the other track for that line is. The track at left is for Line 4 trains towards {{U4E}}.

It is a nice showcase of [[Osthoffian Style]].\n\nIt can be seen that Osthoff21 sees a lot of walls in real life but he has actually no idea of what's behind them.

There are is only an endless system of rooms and corridors. That way, it can be easily noticed that whole the Island station looks terrible from outside, even worse than from the inside.\n\nIn early November 2019 the station underwent a major face lift, with the wooden nonsense around it removed, internal passages widened, cluttered corners cleaned up, and lower part of the building rebuilt in silver sandstone tiles. The resulting interiors and exteriors became far less dungeon-y.\n\nupdate as of jan 2021: the station has been done up and the shop level is open once again with a grinder level and willow from south side and inside has been REMOVED \n\n[[Category:SM1]]\n[[Category:Osthoffian Style]]\n[[Category:Stations]]",

There are no more farms left, unless one counts the backyard of Casa de luli with its orange, palm and banana trees.\n\nThe area on the west of the station previously contained cobbleboxes of cobble, dirt and stone tile; it had been griefed extensively and some of it was protected by {{Player|Och_Noe}}. There are a series of shittle tracks that go nowhere. The whole area could do with a good clean up and redevelopment.\n\nThe griefed land was obtained by {{Player|Blockhead}} and used to make a retail shop.

The L1 runs between KDW, through [[Spawn]] and [[North Harbour]] to a never-started settlement of [[Bamboo City]]. He may have used the L1 for freight but it has never been established as fact.\n\nThe station was first opened to real traffic on 2019-11-28 when the [[Nanepiwer]] started. The station has since been cut from the Nanepiwer service. When it opened, the station originally had a fiddly arrangement of one track beside the mainline such that trains had to cross traffic to get to the platform if going eastbound.

It was built as part of the [[Spawn-South Forest Mainline]], either by {{Player|gabriel}} as architect of the project or by {{Player|kantharos}} as the manager of Land's End.\n\nFor quite a long time since the construction of Land's End West, there has been a plan to make a shuttle service to [[Land's End (Planetarium) Station]], which is the terminus of [[Spawn Subway Line 7]] and the [[Kosha Shuttle]], but this has not yet eventuated. There is not much demand. An on-demand shuttle may be feasible though. Another option would be to extend the Kosha Shuttle; the track already exists to make that possible. In any event, the work would have to be done be kantharos himself.\n\nThe station was built to a poor accessibility standard at first, with no proper way in or out of the station. It was revamped on 2020-07-11 by {{Player|Blockhead}}, who added the stone brick pedestrian overpass on the north and proper station signage.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n=== 2020-07-11 ===\nBefore the revamp\n<gallery>\nLemBeforeRevamp_ViewNorth1.png|Looking north across the platforms, with {{Player|survivalg}} visible.\nLem_ViewNorthWest_BeforeRevamp.png|An E231 service arrives to head south for South Forest.\n</gallery>\n\nAfter the revamp\n<gallery>\nLem_EntranceViewNW.png|Looking northwest at the station entrance and overpass.

The main portion of the station is constructed of silver sandstone tile with aspen wood details.  The platform roof is arched glass while sloped obsidian glass covers the adjoining tracks.  The platform is a pattern of marble, granite and concrete.  A food court is located at the east end of the platform under an obsidian glass roof.  The entrance to the station is from the south and leads to a stone tile lined tunnel that ends at a set of stairs that go up to the platform above.\n\nThe station has two notable automation features: platform lights and automatic safety doors (screen doors).  The lights, embedded in the platform just behind the yellow line, will begin to flash when a train is approaching and become constant when the train stops at the platform.  The lights are turned off when the train departs.  The automatic safety doors, which appear as a glass wall along the edge of the platform, remain closed until a train comes to a stop at the platform.  At that point, sections of the glass corresponding to the length of the train are opened to provide access for embarking and disembarking passengers.  The doors close as the train departs.\n\nBelow ground is a utility area that is not open to the public that houses the circuitry of the platform lights and safety doors.\n\n=== Images ===\n==== 05 September 2020 - The station opens ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Memory_Station_20200905_001047.png|The first train arrives at Memory Station.\nFile:Memory_Station_20200905_001449.png|Looking north towards the entrance of Memory Station.\nFile:Memory_Station_20200905_001531.png|Looking northeast towards Memory Station.\n</gallery>\n==== 04 September 2020 - Preparing to open ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Memory_Station_20200904_144901.png|An interior view of Memory Station.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:S17]]\n\n{{Navbox Personhood Metrorail Lines}}",

The nearby terrain is a mix of a raw mushroom and grassy converted patches<sup>1</sup>. There are roads leading north towards Riverside via Booze Grove and south to the [[Planetarium]]. The street and station are named in honour of Maryam Mirzakhani, a geometer who researched topics such as various non-Euclidean geometries.\n\nThe station's construction is plain but well thought-out, with excellent signage. The two platforms are of stone brick and edged with grey wool to colour code them with Line 7. They each have a U-bahn sign, network map, station name and direction-of-travel sign. The overpass has a sheltered brick station building with arched windows. The station is lit with modern light posts and CNC glo stone tiles on the platforms and the overpass is lit with mese lamps. The tracks sit on mushroom grass, which is a bit of an eyesore.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nMrhStn_OverpassViewSW.png|Looking southwest across the rail overpass,with trains passing both ways.

It has four additional tracks.\n* Track 5: {{S-line-terminus-link|system=Local Lines|line=S23|side=left}}\n* Tracks 6, 7 & 8: No service.\n\n== History ==\nThe station was created early in the server's history (2017) on the [[Spawn-Shanielle Park]] line. Worldedit may have been involved in its creation - {{Player|Blockhead}} found that the inside of the station building's roof was full of light despite it being fully enclosed! The line went via [[Most!]] and headed directly west thereafter to reach [[Shanielle Park]]; it has since been severed at Most! and only the E10 currently travels to that station.\n\nStops for the [[Mom Express]] and [[Manaugh Great Griefing Railway]] were added at some point after the Spawn-Shanielle Park line.\n\nWith the construction of [[Dry Island - Bamboo Hills]], Hume2 built a western station. This station was served by the original incarnation of that line in 2019 until its decommisioning and replacement by the S23. As part of that construction, Hume2 also added a lot of extra trackage to the station.\n\nHume2 responded to criticism of his extra trackage with the following:\n:''According to some critics, the station is currently overdimensed. Some critics say that the historical monumentality was ruined by {{Player|Hume2}}. Fiddlesticks! This is absolute nonsense, because the old station was kept in its original state and the new track was built above it.''\n\nHowever, {{Player|gabriel}}, {{Player|Och_Noe}} and others were not convinced. The S23 was extended to the west station on 13 June 2020, and at that time most of the extraneous trackage was demolished. The crazy floating roundabout and the 2-slope overpass from the Spawn-Shanielle Park line over the top of the station building were demolished. Only the bridge of the Dry Island - Bamboo Hills line has been kept.\n\nThere may be plans to create a 'Hidden Cities' express service to stop at this station in future. It would run from Trap City to Melinka Town via the S20, S23 and E1/E10 tracks. It would not run frequently.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nMomJunction_ViewSouth_northend.png|Express trains pass both ways.

It is the transfer point for travelers that come from the northeast area and want to continue with a train that has its terminus at Euler Street.\n\nServices depart the following tracks:\n* Track 1: {{S20}} to Trap City, {{E31}} to Hippodrome, {{E3}} to Sraczka's Village, {{E32}} to Memorial Mountain\n* Track 2: {{E1}} to Melinka Town, {{E10}} to Most!\n* Track 3: {{E1}} to Personhood, {{E10}} to Euler Street\n* Track 4: {{S20}} to Euler Street\n* Track 5: {{E3}}, {{E31}}, {{E32}} to Euler Street\n* Track 6: [[Museum Shuttle]]\n\n== Railway lines ==\nMountain South is part of the following railway lines:\n* [[Euler Street-Wolf Rock Railway]]\n* [[Spawn-Shanielle Park]]\n* Mountain South - Lighthouse - Apple Grove\n\nEast of the station, there's a nuclear powerplant originally built by ScottishLion83, which also has a track connection. The main track diverges into a branch to [[Euler Street Station]] and a branch to [[Spawn Main Station]] using a diamond junction. In the southeast, a single-track line leads to Darwin Road, connecting to Track 6.\n\nCurrently lines are used for passenger service, but in future the mainline from [[Spawn]] will be bypassed via [[Riverside]] and [[Onionland]] so freight can run from [[Edenwood]] to [[No Idea]].\n\n== History ==\nBack in the time when Trump built the [[Spawn-Shanielle Park]] line, the location of the station served as depot for the 4-carriage trains running on the [[Trump Express]] lines. In 2018, [[User:Orwell]] constructed 4 platforms and a bridge to reach them. On 22th April 2019, orwell removed two of the depot tracks to construct another platform, now platform 3, in order to have 4 platforms for mainline traffic.\n\nMountain South has had a sad history of being forgotten. The lack of signage has no helped before, but {{Player|Blockhead}} installed signs to help guide travellers. Previously, not even the station name was on signs.\n\nOn 2020-10-24, {{player|mary4}} and {{player|gabriel}} performed some slight modifications on the station to make the junctions run smoother. The track assignment got modified such that the entering E1 is not disturbed by trains entering from Euler street and thus has to wait less time in front of the junction.\n\nOn 2021-05-13, {{Player|dario23}} and {{Player|orrwell}} added another platform where the center depot tracks previously were (now new platform 4). The junction east at Half-mile island was reconstructed as grade-separated junction, and the platforms now have pretty roofs.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n=== 2019-10-08 until 2021-05-13 ===\n<gallery>\nMountainSouth_BroadView.png|Broad view of the passenger platforms, with an outbound E1 for Melinka Town visible at track 2.\nMtsConstruction1.png|Half-mile island junction, immediately before reconstruction\n</gallery>\n=== 2021-05-15, After the restoration ===\n\n<gallery>\nMts1.png|The platforms after the restoration\nMts2.png|platform view from overpass\nMts3.png|Shunt tracks where dario23 added lightning\nMts4.png|overpass viewed looking toward east \nMts6.png|thumb|new signage at the station\nMts8.png|thumb|track 6 reserved for the museum shuttle\nMts10.png|Photo of dario23 inside the station with a S20 in the background\nMts11.png|Half-Mile Island junction seen from Tracks 5/6\nMts12.png|Half-Mile Island junction seen from the Spawn Main line\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:S20]]\n[[Category:E1]]\n[[Category:E10]]\n[[Category:E3]]\n[[Category:E31]]\n[[Category:E32]]",

It is built over a small stream that divides [[Onionland]] from land further north. It is located on the north of a two-track rail triangle that is the junction of the [[S1]] and [[Origin-South Forest Line]]s.\n\nThe station is built out of silver sandstone bricks, sandstone bricks and red clay, and lit with LV lamps./xr \n\n== History ==\nA station called White Beaches appears on the long distance railway dating back to May 2017 which is thought to match the location of this station. The name seems to fit, and the line also has previous stops at {{Station|Eiffel Street}} and {{Station|Riverside}} just as the current S1 service does; however that station appears on the map render of 2017-10-31 as on the west side of the railway triangle. The viaduct between what would later become Onionland Beach is visible but appears to have no track.\n\nThe rail triangle was constructed and the station reconstruction on north side between 2017-11-09/2017-11-15. The track was laid on the viaduct in the same period. The [[S1]] could have taken its current shape by that time. This station appears to have been made out of wood and sandstone edges rather than the present materials, with the current form appearing by 2018-07-06, after the settlement of {{Player|imcasper}} nearby.\n\nTSS interlocking was installed here following the [[TSS Update]] with high priority as a mainline location.\n\n{{Player|nanepiwer}} added a ferry dock beneath the station in the latter half of 2020 in preparation for the ferry to [[Windy Mountains]] which is currently inoperable.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nonb_docks_vieweast.png|View east of the dock under the railway.\nOnb_ViewNE_Night_S1.png|An S1 train arrives on the west platform at night.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:S1]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Onionland]]",

In light of an expanding subway network, it became necessary to create a new Onionland station in order to allow extensions of Line {{2}} past this terminus. The new station allows for bidirectional travel. It is perhaps in a more inconvenient location, but there is access from both the east and west end to all directions.

The glo stone was added by {{Player|Blockhead}} on 2020-08-29 when he noticed it was rather dark in the station at night.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nFile:PerelmanStreet SubwayEntrances ViewSouth.png|Looking south along Perelman Street with the subway entrances visible at left.\nPerStn_ViewSouth_U7S.png|A train gets a green signal from the southbound platform.

There is also one additional track that is presumably intended for parking or storage; it is attached to the Island Shuttle line tracks.\n\nThe underground portion is for the Personhood Metrorail and has 2 tracks and 1 island platform.  It is built of desert stone brick and marble. All metrorail lines run through this station and share the one platform.\n\n== History ==\nA railway was first built in the period late January-Mid February 2018 but no station was yet built. The [[Piet Train]] appears to have been started in mid July 2018 and in the following month of August the station was first built with the 4 surface platforms it currently has. Tracks 1-2 were connected to the [[E1]] line and tracks 3-4 were connected to the [[Stallmangrad-Personhood Mainline]].\n\nThe main station was one of the earliest features in Personhood. [[Birch Bay Transport]] operated an express that stopped at [[Lusin Street Station|Lusin Street]], [[The Cube]], Personhood Main, [[GRUB Valley Station|Grub Valley]] and [[Oasis Station|Oasis]] in the pre-[[TSS]] era. The line north to GRUB Valley and Oasis was left abandoned for a long time until circa January 2020 when the newer Oasis Express service started.\n\n== Services ==\n* Track 1: {{OEX}} to Oasis stopping at [[Grub Valley Station|Grub Valley]]\n* Track 2: {{E1}} towards Melinka Town\n* Track 3: {{SM1}} towards Stallmangrad\n* Track 4: No service\n* Track 5: [[Piet Rail]] services.\n* Track 6: [[Chiculata Express]] towards Roses Gardens (Godwin Austen)\n* Track 7: [[OTL Diamond Line]] to Neverbuild and Shore\n* Subway: 2 tracks for [[Personhood Metrorail]]\n\n== Nearby Points of Interest ==\nThe main exit is located at the west side of the station.

Although there is only one track through the station, there were platforms on both sides of it. Unfortunately, advtrains cannot open the doors on both sides, so the train only opened its doors on the right in direction of travel. The same style was preserved for the new station building, however it now has two tracks.\n\nBetween 2020-09-11/2020-09-24, the old Piet Station was demolished and a new one rebuild northwest of the old location. The Mithril Line was rerouted to stop at Neverbuild West and The Cube Valley and so the alignment of the tracks towards The Cube had to change; the old state of the railway was also much worse, without ballast, while the new alignment was on a viaduct with supports. The old site at {{Co|1210|14|2045}} is now part of a small rollingstock storage yard. In the old alignment, the mithril line stopped in between The Cube and Central, rather than The Cube Valley and Neverbuild West as it currently does.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n=== 2020-03-31 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:PietStation EastView.png|An OTL Mithril Line train waits before departing for Neverbuild Central.\n</gallery>\n=== 2022-07-28 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Piet station inside.png|The interior of the station\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:OTL Mithril Line]]",

At that time, Line 5 had been extended from Lone Island (a stop that has now been deleted).

Between the 4 and 24th of May that year (2020-06-04/2020-06-24), the highway was cut and the area filled with flat grass by {{Player|anju64}}. This leaves the section starting at Origin Island to lead to the eastern streets of [[North Harbour]] and the section after Anju Crossing which continues to [[Bananawood]]. It is unclear why this happened, as it does not seem beneficial to the transport system at all.

The building is mostly made of redwood and features separate waiting rooms for first and second class.\n\n== Train services ==\nOnly the Mom Express stops at Redwood Island. Like the entire line, Redwood Island has only got one track from which the train departs in both directions. It is strongly recommended to pay attention to the sign on the station building that says which one of the other two stations lies in which direction, for if you want to travel to [[Mom Junction]] to catch an express, you may lose a lot of time if you accidentally take a train to [[Mom's Island Station]].\n\n== History ==\nRedwood Island started out as a plain platform. Not only did it lack any signs or decoration, not to mention a station building, but the surrounding land was mostly at least two metres high, so it was almost impossible to leave the platform after getting off the train except for the very east towards the shore.\n\nIn early 2018, [[User:Buddler|Buddler]], probably the only halfway active inhabitant of the island, decided that this had to change. He requested building rights from [[User:Gabriel|Gabriel]] who owned the land surrounding the platform and literally built the station building into the small hill behind the platform, disregarding all warnings that Gabriel may have him build more station buildings. Buddler ended up also building [[Bamboo Beach Station|Bamboo Beach]], [[East Bend Station|East Bend]] and [[Mirzakhani Street Subway Station|Mirzakhani Street]] upon Gabriel's requests, also naming the former two as they had been nameless until then.\n\nReaching Redwood Island proved to be difficult at times. The Mom Express has a history of griefing and then remaining shut down for months. Whenever this happened, Redwood Island could only be reached by walking or biking on Wau Holland Drive all the way from the [[Spawn]] area or swimming or sailing from Mom Junction.\n\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:Mom Express]]",

The area may have been imported from LinuxWorks server (the predecessor to LinuxWorks Next Generation, now LinuxForks).

It is in a kind-of neapoliton ice cream colour scheme, with mainly banana wood but also jungle and aspen woods used in the construction. The platform edge is of stone bricks, possibly because most of the materials now used for platforms were yet to be added to the advtrains_platform mod. The station is lit with super glow glass. In terms of information, there is no nice place for a subway map and no direction of travel indication.\n\n== History ==\nThe station is thought to have opened in June 2017. It was the southern terminus of the line when the station was opened. For this reason, there used to be a crossover for trains to return northwards. This became disused with the extension of Line 7 to Planetarium in December 2017 and was finally removed when Line 7 was interlocked on 23 April 2020.

Adjacent to it can be found remnants of unprotected noob huts. West of the station, [[User:Hume2|Hume2]] built a viewing deck for a black hole. It includes a sign that details the significance of the \"Schwarzschild radius\". South of the station, next to the McFly Street subway station, is an outpost of the [[Treehouse Hotel]].\n\n== History ==\nThe station was first built between 2018-01-25/2018-02-24. It opened as a subway stop of [[Spawn Subway Line 4]], which at that time ran to {{Station|Lusin Street}}. It opened with two platforms but over the same area as the current 3 island platforms, just with the west side regional platform being much wider than it now is. Eventually the S12 to Ehlodex was added as well as the E1 to Personhood.\n\nThe original poor construction of the station was improved between 2019-01-28/2019-05-04. A roof over the subway station was added as well as a more sensible size for the regional platform and a small subway depot.\n\nFor the [[East-West Link]] project, [[DURT]] added a track through the east of this station in September 2019. Works starting around 20 December and ending the 22nd split the west half (regional trains) of the station into two island platforms instead of the previous one. The DURT track was removed in favour of routing freight trains through Track 5. DURT eventually added passing loops on the north and south sides of the stations to hopefully avoid any potential deadlocking issues from passing train movements.\n\n=== The Name ===\nThe station is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild Karl Schwarzschild].\n\nThe original station name was \"Schwarzschildt Street\", including a \"t\" at the end. This spelling mistake was not corrected for a long time and is still present in most older maps.\n\nWith the new subway map introduced in 2019, the old name was deprecated along with other typos like Pytagoras (Pythagoras) Road and the German spelling Sacharow (Sakharov) Street.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n<gallery>\nSws_ViewEast_Faraway.png|View of the station from a nearby river bridge.\nSws_SubwayPlatform.png|A subway train waits at the platform before departing south.\nSws_SubwayDepot.png|The subway depot, which has 3 tracks and room for 6 trains.

It is served by trains of the {{E1}} line. The name was given after the original protected area by Aksum, which probably had no real significance.\n\nThe station is at an altitude of 10 meters and is at about 1.1 km from the {{Station|Melinka Town}} station, which is the western terminus of the {{E1}} line. It is near the junction between the tracks of {{E1}} and the ones of the {{NX}} line, which leads to {{Station|South Forest}}, as well as near a jungle.\n\n== History ==\nThe station was first constructed in the period 2019-05-04/2019-05-14 as a stop on the way to Melinka Town on what would later be known as the Melinka Town Mainlone. The nearby jungle junction did not exist at that time and the station simple had two tracks passing through on the mainline. The station was originally poorly constructed; it was made of stone tiles, and the platforms of grey bricks. There is was signage or lightning at all, nor any \"entrance\" or \"exit\".\n\nThe junction was constructed in a grade separated fashion between 2019-06-08/2019-06-19, which resulted in the construction of the tunnel portal to the east of the station. After the construction of the jungle, a new line continued straight west from the junction. That westbound line was built in [[Trump Express Lines]] fashion and later demolished. The line also continued southwest past St-15-0 as it had previously. In what was later considered a poorly planned move, a new track pair was constructed in that same period that came in just west of the station from the line that went westbound down to the Melinka Town Mainline.\n\nBetween 2021-02-20/2021-03-06 {{Player|orrwell}} revamped the junction and the original St-15-0 was disconnected from the network and its tunnel taken out of commission. A replacement set of platforms was built by {{Player|dario23}} at 45 degrees along the mainline. The mainline was increased to four tracks so that other trains can pass while the E1 trains stop at the station. Building a station on a diagonal was previously not possible when the station was originally built due to the lack of 45 degree platforms, which may have been a factor as to the station's odd original placement. \"Aksum's Folly?\" was written on the new station signs suggesting a possible name change, or a name rather than merely a designation.\n\nBetween 2021-03-06/2021-04-18, a small museum building was built around a slice of the old track (or possibly a reconstruction), called the \"Museum of How It Used To Be Around Here\"\n\n== Screenshots ==\n=== 2020 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:St-15-0 Station.png|The station in 2020.\nFile:St-15-0 Station 2.png|A {{E1}} train.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2022-05-11 ===\n<gallery>\nSt-15-0_ViewNorth2022-05-11.png|Looking north across the platforms while an E1 train waits before departing northeast. \nSt-15-0_Museum.png|Looking east at the Museum of How It Used To Be Around Here\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Stations]]\n[[Category:E1]]",

Currently the only service is from track 5, with the {{SM1}} [[SM1|train to Personhood]].\n\n== History ==\nStallmangrad was founded around January 2018. The town hall and main station first appaer on the [[maps|map]] render of the 18 January 2018. Prior to this time, regional services had terminated at [[Our Lady of the Editor Station|Our Lady of the Editor]], as seen on some of the long distance network maps. It is not known exatly when trains started terminating at Stallmangrad instead. Service to Our Lady of The Editor is now by a train the departs [[Gare de Paris Lyon]].\n\nBetween July and August 2018, the lines to Happysmash and Tuxopolis were built, and service from Stallmangrad likely began shortly thereafter. In the same period, the [[Stallmangrad-Personhood Line]] was also built.\n\nThe Nanepiwer service was opened and added at this station on 18 August 2019.

It is built as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_interchange cross-platform interchange]. The underground island platform serves Line 1 trains continuing east to [[Windy Mountains]] as well as Line 2 trains that terminate. The above ground island platform serves Line 1 and Line 2 trains heading west towards [[Origin]] and beyond. The ground level connects the two platforms and houses an ATM.\n\nOn 2020-08-20, Line 2 had a passenger platform added at its reversing terminus, marked ''Szymon's Dam Regional''. On 2020-12-20, Line 1 short-stopping services were introduced, with half of all services terminating early at Szymon's Dam. To facilitate this, Line 1 now has a reversing terminal beside the Line 2 reversing terminal, making the subway stop ''Szymon's Dam Regional'' an island platform.\n\n== Hume Line Stop ==\n\nEast of the subway station runs the [[Hume Line]] high above the surrounding landscape.

It is named after a giant stone cube that seems to be a technic factory. This area is located on a grassy island in the middle of a large dry dirt plain.\n\nOver the northern overpass from the regional platforms, on the east of the station, are platforms for [[Osthoff21 Train Lines]], accessible only by elevator. The [[OTL Mithril Line]] terminates on the ground level, and the Ice Line is accessible by that platform via elevator only as well.\n\n== History ==\nThe Spawn-Personhood mainline began construction between 2018-07-06/2018-07-25, reaching north almost to where [[S\u00fcdkreuz Station (Personhood)|S\u00fcdkreuz Station]] is found today. Mercant appears to have started building The Cube at this time. A proper station was added between 2018-07-25/2018-08-22, and The Cube itself was complete as it stands today, with a river flowing down and grass around. Neverbild had not been settled at this time, though [[Island]] was in construction. A first shittle track was added from Island to The Cube between 2018-08-22/2018-10-04. [[Piet Station (Neverbuild)|Piet Station]] seems to have begun early construction around this time, as well as the site of the current [[Neverbuild Central Station]]. Neverbuild proper had been begun by 2018-12-31 and the Neverbuild Branch line was almost certainly in service.\n\nBy August 2019, the [[ATL Bronze Line]] had begun service on the [[Spawn-Personhood Mainline]], sharing the same tracks. Due to an excessive amount of trains, the Bronze Line clogged the mainline. Two tracks from [[Colored Grasses]] to The Cube were added, so that the ATL-Bronze trains had their own tracks up to this station. The Bronze Line trains travel on the outer tracks while the regional [[LinuxForks Rail]] services travel on the inner track pair.\n\nA rapid development of lines in the Neverbuild area in December 2019 resulted in the formation of [[Osthoff21 Train Lines]] (OTL). Thus, the old name 'Neverbuild Branch Line' was replaced with 'OTL Mithril Line'. The Ice Line, which had previously been a shuttle between [[Island Station|Island]] and [[Neverbuild Central Station]], was extended west to stop at Town Hall and The Cube soon before the formation of OTL.\n\nIn May 2020, the track pair of the ATL Bronze Line was continued up to [[Personhood West Station|Personhood West]].\n\nIn the first half of 2022, OTL Ice Line was extended past The Cube, continuing in its subway tunnel.\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n=== 2019-08-10 ===\n(See earlier revisions of these files at this date)\n<gallery>\nThe_Cube_Overpass.png|View across the overpass from the regional platform towards the elevator for the train to [[Neverbuild]].\nThe_Cube_Platform_Local.png|The local train platform, which has a train that goes to [[Island]].\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2022-06-23 ===\n<gallery>\nThe_Cube_Overpass.png|View across the overpass from the regional platform towards the elevator for the train to [[Neverbuild]].\nThe_Cube_Platform_Local.png|The local train platform, which has a train that goes to [[Island]].\nFile:TheCubeStn PIDs ViewNorth.png|Looking at the arrivals board on the south side of the station.
